<titleFont>Strategies:</titleFont><br />
<*> Take and hold the high ground!<br />
<*> All the OPs are mutually supporting and make good positions to cover the others.<br />
<*> Defend in depth!<br />
<*> Helicopter support, fancy optics and heavy weapons are out of the picture due to COIN posturing and/or budget cuts.<br />
<*> It takes 1 minute to get to Khushab on the north road and 3 minutes on the south road.<br />
<*> Whatever you do, get organised FAST, get things done FAST and STICK IT TO THE ENEMY!<br />
